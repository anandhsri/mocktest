# TP-Link Router Admin Password Guide

## Method 1: Check Router Label (Most Common)

1. **Look at the bottom or back of your TP-Link router**
2. Find the sticker/label with router information
3. Look for:
   - **Username**: Usually `admin`
   - **Password**: Often printed on the label
   - **Default Access**: May show `admin/admin` or similar

## Method 2: Common Default Passwords

TP-Link routers commonly use:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin`
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: (blank/empty - just press Enter)
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password`

## Method 3: Check Router Documentation

- Check the user manual that came with the router
- Look for "Default Login Credentials" section
- Check the quick start guide

## Method 4: TP-Link Model-Specific Defaults

Some models have specific defaults:
- **Archer series**: Usually `admin/admin`
- **TL-WR series**: Usually `admin/admin` or blank password
- **Deco series**: Uses TP-Link account (different login)

## Method 5: Reset Router to Factory Defaults

If you can't find the password, you can reset the router:

### ⚠️ WARNING: This will erase all your router settings!

1. **Find the Reset Button**
   - Usually a small hole on the back/bottom of the router
   - May be labeled "Reset" or "RST"

2. **Reset Process**
   - Power on the router
   - Use a paperclip or pin to press and hold the reset button
   - Hold for 10-15 seconds
   - Router will restart (LEDs will blink)
   - Release the button

3. **After Reset**
   - Router will use default credentials (usually `admin/admin`)
   - You'll need to reconfigure:
     - Wi-Fi network name (SSID)
     - Wi-Fi password
     - Internet connection settings
     - Any custom settings

## Method 6: Check if Password Was Changed

If someone set a custom password:
- Try common passwords: `password`, `1234`, `admin123`
- Check if you wrote it down somewhere
- Ask family members who might have set it up

## Method 7: Access via TP-Link Tether App

Some newer TP-Link routers can be managed via the **TP-Link Tether** mobile app:
1. Download "TP-Link Tether" from App Store/Play Store
2. Connect to your router's Wi-Fi
3. Open the app - it may show login info or allow access

## Security Best Practices

After accessing your router:
1. **Change the default password** to something secure
2. **Write it down** in a safe place
3. **Update router firmware** for security
4. **Enable WPA3** or **WPA2** for Wi-Fi security

## Quick Test

Try these combinations in order:
1. `admin` / `admin`
2. `admin` / (blank - just press Enter)
3. `admin` / `password`
4. Check router label for actual credentials

## Still Can't Access?

If none of the above work:
1. **Reset the router** (Method 5) - this will restore defaults
2. **Contact TP-Link support** with your router model number
3. **Check router model** - some newer models use different login methods
