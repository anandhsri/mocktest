# GitHub Repository URL Information

## ⚠️ Project Not Yet on GitHub

Your project is **committed locally** but **not yet pushed to GitHub**.

## 📍 What Your GitHub URL Will Be

Once you create and push the repository, your URL will be:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neet-mock-test
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## 🚀 Steps to Get Your GitHub URL

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: `neet-mock-test` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "CBSE 10th Grade Mock Test Application"
4. Choose: **Private** (recommended) or **Public**
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you the repository URL. It will look like:
- HTTPS: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neet-mock-test.git`
- SSH: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/neet-mock-test.git`

### Step 3: Connect and Push

Run these commands (replace `YOUR_USERNAME`):

```bash
cd /Users/anandsrinivasan/neet-mock-test

# Add the remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neet-mock-test.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Access Your Repository

After pushing, visit:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neet-mock-test
```
