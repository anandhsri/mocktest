## Question 1 (5 Marks) - Electricity
**Year:** 2023 | **Chapter:** Electricity

State Ohm's law. Draw a circuit diagram to verify Ohm's law. A student performs an experiment and obtains the following data:

| Voltage (V) | Current (A) |
|-------------|-------------|
| 2.0         | 0.4         |
| 4.0         | 0.8         |
| 6.0         | 1.2         |
| 8.0         | 1.6         |

(a) Plot a graph of V vs I.
(b) Calculate the resistance of the conductor.
(c) What would be the current when voltage is 10V?

**Expected Answer Points:**
- Statement of Ohm's law: V ∝ I or V = IR (1 mark)
- Circuit diagram with ammeter, voltmeter, resistor, battery, and key (1 mark)
- Graph plotting V vs I (straight line through origin) (1 mark)
- Calculation: R = V/I = 2.0/0.4 = 5Ω (1 mark)
- Current at 10V: I = V/R = 10/5 = 2A (1 mark)

## Question 2 (5 Marks) - Light - Reflection and Refraction
**Year:** 2024 | **Chapter:** Light - Reflection and Refraction

An object is placed at a distance of 30 cm from a concave mirror of focal length 15 cm.

(a) Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of image.
(b) State the position, nature, and size of the image formed.
(c) If the object is moved 10 cm towards the mirror, what will be the new position of the image?

**Expected Answer Points:**
- Ray diagram with at least two rays (incident parallel to principal axis, passing through focus) (2 marks)
- Image position calculation using mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u (1 mark)
- Image characteristics: Real, inverted, same size, at 30 cm (1 mark)
- New position calculation when object moves to 20 cm (1 mark)

## Question 3 (5 Marks) - Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
**Year:** 2022 | **Chapter:** Magnetic Effects of Electric Current

Explain the working of an electric motor with the help of a labeled diagram. State Fleming's left-hand rule. A current-carrying conductor experiences a force when placed in a magnetic field. Explain why this happens and what factors affect the magnitude of this force.

**Expected Answer Points:**
- Labeled diagram of electric motor (armature, commutator, brushes, field magnets) (1.5 marks)
- Explanation of working principle (rotation due to force on current-carrying conductor) (1 mark)
- Statement of Fleming's left-hand rule (1 mark)
- Explanation of force and factors affecting it (F = BIL) (1.5 marks)

## Question 4 (5 Marks) - The Human Eye and the Colourful World
**Year:** 2021 | **Chapter:** The Human Eye and the Colourful World

Explain the following phenomena with reasons:

(a) Why does the sky appear blue during the day?
(b) Why does the sun appear reddish at sunrise and sunset?
(c) What causes the formation of a rainbow?

Also, explain the defect of vision called myopia. How can it be corrected? Draw a ray diagram showing the correction.

**Expected Answer Points:**
- Explanation of blue sky (scattering of blue light) (1 mark)
- Explanation of red sun (scattering, longer path) (1 mark)
- Explanation of rainbow (dispersion and total internal reflection) (1 mark)
- Myopia explanation and correction with ray diagram (2 marks)
